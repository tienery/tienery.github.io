{"name":"tienery's Github Repo's","tagline":"Colouring your Journey","body":"# Tienery\r\nHere is my personal blog/repo updates.\r\n\r\n## Biography\r\nMy name is Luke Selman, aka \"tienery\", and I am a British-born software programmer, business enthusiast and currently made of nonsense. At the age of 13, I started programming in Visual Basic. When I went to college at the age of 16/17, my first project was called Colour Matching. To cut a long story, this did not last.\r\n\r\nDespite that, I continued to self-teach programming, and after going to Uni at 18 (and dropping out the same academic year), I was hooked onto C# after learning the basics. If it was not for Uni, I may have never learned C#, as one of the subjects was learning the language. Eventually, I returned to college to complete a vocational degree in Business, which I believe turned out to be useless, given my current circumstances.\r\n\r\nHowever, as I was learning Business, I eventually discovered Haxe after being introduced to it by a friend from Newgrounds. This, as you can probably tell, is now my most used programming language, and intend to create my own GUI interfaces with OpenFL mostly with the intention of being closer to the \"native feel\" and with high customisation.\r\n\r\n## Repositories\r\n\r\n### Haxe\r\n\r\n#### OpenFL GUI\r\nOpenFL GUI is an open source library that contains a collection of highly customisable user interface controls.\r\n\r\nCurrent version: 2.0.0-alpha.7\r\n\r\nDownload: `git clone https://github.com/tienery/openfl-gui.git`\r\n\r\n[Website](http://tienery.github.io/openfl-gui/)\r\n\r\n***\r\n### C&#35;\r\n\r\n#### GDI Canvas\r\nGDI Canvas is a System.Drawing library that provides a more object-oriented approach to the drawing routines of GDI+.\r\n\r\nCurrent version: 1.0.2\r\n\r\nDownload: `git clone https://github.com/tienery/GDICanvas.git`","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
