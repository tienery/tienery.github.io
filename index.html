<p>Here is my personal blog/repo updates.</p>

<a id="biography" class="anchor" href="#biography" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Biography</h2>

<p>My name is Luke Selman, aka "tienery", and I am a British-born software programmer, business enthusiast and currently made of nonsense. At the age of 13, I started programming in Visual Basic. When I went to college at the age of 16/17, my first project was called Colour Matching. To cut a long story, this did not last.</p>

<p>Despite that, I continued to self-teach programming, and after going to Uni at 18 (and dropping out the same academic year), I was hooked onto C# after learning the basics. If it was not for Uni, I may have never learned C#, as one of the subjects was learning the language. Eventually, I returned to college to complete a vocational degree in Business, which I believe turned out to be useless, given my current circumstances.</p>

<p>However, as I was learning Business, I eventually discovered Haxe after being introduced to it by a friend from Newgrounds. This, as you can probably tell, is now my most used programming language, and intend to create my own GUI interfaces with OpenFL mostly with the intention of being closer to the "native feel" and with high customisation.</p>
